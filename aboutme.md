## My Story

### Artistic me:

I have natural interest towards creativity of any-form whether it is Traditional Indian music or drawing. Talking about, traditional drawing forms I like and have done some of them : <em><b> Madhubani</em></b>, <em><b> Warli</em></b> and <em><b> Coffee Painting</em></b> and also won several competition including Global art comepetion bagging, first place.
And in traditional music form especially, the <em><b> Carnatic </em></b> music form, haven been trained for 6-7 years and also participated in events to show case my music skills.
